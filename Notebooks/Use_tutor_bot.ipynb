       "Your response to the exam question shows an understanding of the need to modify the energy of the hydrogen atom when an external magnetic field is applied, but there are several inaccuracies and areas for improvement in your answer:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Misunderstanding of Photon Absorption**: Your answer suggests that the modification of the energy involves the absorption of a photon. This is incorrect in the context of the question. The modification of the energy in this scenario is due to the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field, not due to photon absorption.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Hamiltonian Modification**: You did not mention how the Hamiltonian operator is modified to include the magnetic interaction term. The correct approach is to add a term that accounts for the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the magnetic field, specifically, $\\frac{eB_z}{2m_e} \\hat{L}_z$.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Schrodinger Equation Formulation**: The Schrödinger equation in the absence of an external magnetic field should be formulated using only the kinetic and Coulomb potential terms, as shown in the example good answer. Your response did not provide this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Energy Levels in a Magnetic Field**: You did not address how the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are affected by the external magnetic field. The energy levels are split due to the Zeeman effect, which is a result of the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment associated with the electron's orbital angular momentum.\n",
       "\n",
       "To improve your understanding and answer, consider reviewing the following sections in the textbook \"Quantum Chemistry\" by Donald A. McQuarrie:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Chapter 7.3**: This section discusses the Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom and how it is constructed from classical descriptions.\n",
       "- **Chapter 7.4**: Focus on how external fields affect the Hamiltonian and the resulting changes in the energy levels of the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "By reviewing these sections, you should gain a better understanding of how to correctly modify the Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in the presence of an external magnetic field and how to derive the corresponding Schrödinger equation. This will also help you understand the physical significance of each term in the Hamiltonian and the energy equation.\n"
