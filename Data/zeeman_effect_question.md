The radius of the orbit is $r = 5.0 \times 10^{-11}$ meters, and the velocity of the electron is $ v = 2.2 \times 10^6 $ meters per second. Assume the fundamental charge of the electron is $ e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} $ coulombs.

**Part A:** Calculate the current $ I $ generated by the electron in its orbit.

Annotate how you know that the magnetic moment is in fact a vector $\mathbf{\mathbf{m}}$.


### Question 2
Now we add a magnetic field, where $\mathbf{B}$ is the strength of the field in Teslas.

 $\mathbf{B}$ is defined as $\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$, where $\mathbf{F}$ is the force (a vector) acting on charge $q$, which is moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in a magnetic field of strength $\mathbf{B}$.

We also now introduce the idea that potential energy $V$ is: $V =- \mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{B}$.

**Part A**
Why do we use a dot product for this product of two vectors?

**Part B** Why is there a minus sign in this equation?

### Question 3
Let's assume the applied field is in the $z$ direction, and:
- $$V =- m_z B_z$$
For the electron we had:
- $$\mathbf{m} = \frac{-e}{2m_e} \mathbf{L}$$
- So $$m_z=\frac{-eL_z}{2m_e}=-\frac{V}{B_z}$$
- So $$V=\frac{eB_zL_z}{2m_e}$$
- And this is the potential energy for when there is an external magnetic field applied to an orbiting electron.
- Recall that to solve the Schrodinger Equation for the Hydrogen atom we built up a Hamiltonian Operator, which we will call $\hat{H_0}$, that had a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term.

**Part A** How do we now modify the energy of our Hydrogen Atom, in classical terms? Describe in words what each of the three terms will represent?

**Part C** Write out the Schrodinger equation that would be obtained for our hydrogen atom in the absence of an external magnetic field using $\hat{H_0}$. You may use equation 7.12 from the text book to help you remember the eignevalue.

**Part D** Given what you already know about the solution to the eigenvalue equation for $\hat{L}_z\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$
what does the energy of our hydrogen atom become, in an applied external magnetic field, where we can simplify things by defining:
$$\beta_B=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$$





Answer Key:

## Question 1:
An electron is orbiting in a circular path around a nucleus with a constant velocity. The radius of the orbit is $r = 5.0 \times 10^{-11}$ meters, and the velocity of the electron is $v = 2.2 \times 10^6$ meters per second. Assume the fundamental charge of the electron is $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

**Part A:** Calculate the current $I$ generated by the electron in its orbit. 

- Time for one complete orbit (period) is given by $T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$.
- Plugging in the values:

- $ T = \frac{2\pi \times 5.0 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}}{2.2 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}} \approx 1.43 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s} $
- Current $I$ is defined as charge per unit time, so $I = \frac{e}{T}$.
- $ I = \frac{e}{T} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}{1.43 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s}} \approx 1.12 \times 10^{-3} \text{ A} $

**Part B:** Compute the magnetic moment $\mu$ generated by the electron's orbit.
- Area $A$ of the loop is $A = \pi r^2$.
- Magnetic moment $\mu$ is calculated as $\mu = I \times A$.

- $ A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (5.0 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m})^2 \approx 7.85 \times 10^{-21} \text{ m}^2 $


- $ m = I \times A = 1.12 \times 10^{-3} \text{ A} \times 7.85 \times 10^{-21} \text{ m}^2 \approx 8.80 \times 10^{-24} \text{ A m}^2 $

**Part C:** Derive an equation for the angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ of the electron, as a vector quantity in terms of the position vector and the velocity vector of the electron. If the electron is orbiting anticlockwise in the $xy$ plane, state the direction of the angular momentum vector and how it relates to the plane of the electron's orbit. Calculate the vector for the angular momentum of the electron, given that the electron's position is $\mathbf{r}=r\mathbf{i}$ and its velocity is $\mathbf{v}=v\mathbf{j}$.
- Angular momentum vector $\mathbf{L}$ is the cross product of position vector $\mathbf{r}$ and momentum vector $\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}$, so $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}$.
- For $\mathbf{r} = r\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{v} = v\mathbf{j}$, $$\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} = mv\mathbf{j}$$
- thus $$\mathbf{L} = r\mathbf{i} \times mv\mathbf{j} = rmv\mathbf{k}$$.
- The direction of $\mathbf{L}$ is perpendicular to the plane of orbit (along $\mathbf{k}$ axis) because the cross product of vectors in the plane produces a vector perpendicular to that plane.

**Part D:** Use the angular momentum derived in Part C to calculate the magnetic moment vector $\mathbf{m}$ for the electron, given its mass $m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kg.
- Magnetic moment vector $\mathbf{m}$ is given by $\mathbf{m} = \frac{-e}{2m} \mathbf{L}$.
- Substituting the values, we get $\mathbf{m} = \frac{-e}{2m} rmv\mathbf{k}$.
- The magnetic moment vector $\mathbf{m}$ is perpendicular to the plane of motion, aligning with $\mathbf{L}$, and its direction is determined by the right-hand rule. Note that the negative sign here is associated with the negative charge on the electron.


## Question 2
Now we add a magnetic field, where $\mathbf{B}$ is the strength of the field in Teslas.

$\mathbf{B}$ is defined as $$\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$$, where $\mathbf{F}$ is the force (a vector) acting on charge $q$, which is moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in a magnetic field of strength $\mathbf{B}$.

We also now introduce the idea that potential energy $V$ is: $V =- \mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{B}$.

**Part A**
Why do we use a dot product for this product of two vectors?
- The dot product is used to calculate the component of one vector along the direction of another. In the context of the potential energy equation, $$V = -\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{B}$$, the dot product determines how much of the magnetic moment vector $\mathbf{m}$ is aligned with the magnetic field vector $\mathbf{B}$. This alignment contributes to the potential energy, which depends directly on the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, thus quantifying the degree of alignment.

**Part B** 
Why is there a minus sign in this equation?
- The minus sign indicates that the potential energy is lowest (most favorable) when the magnetic moment and the magnetic field are aligned. This alignment minimizes the potential energy of the system, which is energetically favorable. Essentially, the system lowers its energy by aligning with the external field, hence the negative sign in the potential energy expression. Another way of looking at this is that when the north pole of one magnet is pointing towards the south pole of another, the fields are in alignment and therefore we see a lowering of the potential energy, just like a negative energy denoted an attraction between a positive charge and a negative charge regarding Coulomb's law and electrostatics

## Question 3
Let's assume the applied field is in the $z$ direction, and:
- $V =- m_z B_z$

For the electron we had:
- $$\mathbf{m} = \frac{-e}{2m_e} \mathbf{L}$$
- So $$m_z=\frac{-eL_z}{2m_e}=-\frac{V}{B_z}$$
- So $$V=\frac{eB_zL_z}{2m_e}$$
- And this is the potential energy for when there is an external magnetic field applied to an orbiting electron.
- Recall that to solve the Schrodinger Equation for the Hydrogen atom we built up a Hamiltonian Operator, which we will call $$\hat{H_0}$$, that had a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term.

**Part A** 
How do we now modify the energy of our Hydrogen Atom, in classical terms? Describe in words what each of the three terms will represent?
- To account for the magnetic field, the energy of the hydrogen atom must include the magnetic interaction term. The modified energy consists of the original kinetic and potential energy terms from $\hat{H_0}$ plus an additional term for the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the magnetic field. These terms represent:
  1. Kinetic Energy: Energy due to the motion of the electron.
  2. Coulomb Potential Energy: Energy due to the electrostatic potential between the electron and the nucleus.
  3. Magnetic Potential Energy: Energy arising from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field.

**Part B** 
What does our Hamiltonian operator, $\hat{H}$ now become in terms of $$\hat{H_0}$$ and $\hat{L}_z$?
- The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ now includes the Zeeman term due to the magnetic field:
  $$\hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \frac{eB_z}{2m_e} \hat{L}_z$$
  This term represents the interaction between the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic field along the z-axis.

**Part C** 
Write out the Schrodinger equation that would be obtained for our hydrogen atom in the absence of an external magnetic field using $\hat{H_0}$.
- The Schrodinger equation in the absence of an external magnetic field is:
  $$\hat{H_0} \psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi) = -\frac{m_e e^4}{8\epsilon_0^2h^2n^2} \psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$$
  Where $\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$ is the wave function of the electron, $E$ is the energy eigenvalue, and $\hat{H_0}$ includes only the kinetic and Coulomb potential terms.

**Part D** 
Given that we also know:
$$\hat{L}_z\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)=m_l\hbar\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$$
what does the energy of our hydrogen atom become, in an applied external magnetic field, where we can simplify things by defining:
$$\beta_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2m_e}$$

In the presence of an external magnetic field, specifically aligned along the z-axis, the energy of the hydrogen atom can be described by modifying the Hamiltonian to include the interaction between the electron’s magnetic moment and the magnetic field. Hence the Schrodinger equation is now:
$$\hat{H}\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi) = \hat{H_0}\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi) + \frac{\beta_B}{\hbar} B_z \hat{L}_z\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$$

Hence 

$$\hat{H}\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi) = (-\frac{m_e e^4}{8\epsilon_0^2h^2n^2} +\beta_Bm_lB_z)\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)$$

So $$E =-\frac{m_e e^4}{8\epsilon_0^2h^2n^2} +\beta_Bm_lB_z$$ 

This additional term represents the interaction energy between the magnetic moment associated with the electron's orbital angular momentum and the external magnetic field. The sign and magnitude of $m_l$ determine the direction and strength of this interaction relative to the magnetic field. The overall effect is that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are split into multiple levels, depending on the value of $m_l$, which quantifies the component of the angular momentum along the direction of the magnetic field. This splitting is a direct manifestation of the Zeeman effect, which can lead to observable spectral lines corresponding to transitions between these split energy levels.
